# Beautiful Jekyll

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal blogs or simple project websites.  [Check out a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes.  You can also look at [my personal website](http://deanattali.com) to see it in use, or see examples of websites other people created using this theme [here](#showcased-users-success-stories).

**This theme was developed for non-commerical purposes. For commerical usage, or if you enjoy this theme, please consider [supporting me](https://www.paypal.me/daattali/20) for developing and maintaining this template.**

To create a website similar to mine, first create a GitHub account. Then go to https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll and fork the repository (in the top right of the site). Then create a repository named "your GitHub user name".github.io. If you have an ssh key, click the green clone button in the top right and select SSH. If not, continue with HTTPS. Paste this code into the terminal window and hit enter. Next, go into the local directory for your website and type "bundle install --path ~/.gem" and wait for it to say done (this can take up to 15 minutes). Now, once this step is done, type "bundle exec jekyll serve" to start a local web server. To see your site, copy and paste the http line that it provides. On GitHub, go to the label with "GitHub Pages" and make sure that there is a green check mark that says the web site is currently hosting your page. Starting now, you can edit the "config.yml" file and other such files to make the website your own. When you are done, use git commands (add, commit, push) to push the changes to your repository. This should update your public website. As a side note, make sure to go to settings in your repository and check the issues box so other people can help improve your site!
