TL;DR: Although Google has made some incredible tools that make life easier for the consumers of the world, with everything in one place, if one account gets compromised, one's whole world can be turned upside down.

In today's society, it seems that everything needs to be intertwined with something else. Social media and the internet have transformed the way we live. One example is the use of Google for practically everything. Although it started out as a search engine so that people could find anything on the internet, it has continued to grow and merge with other necessities. Today, even though the search engine is still incredibly popular, Google has seeped deeper into our lives. Now millions of people use Google Chrome for their internet browser, Google Play Apps and Music for their entertainment, YouTube for their internet video needs, and even Google Drive, Docs, and other utilities for business and academic work. All of these aspects are under the Google name, and even under one single account.

This account stores your search history, usernames, e-mails, and passwords for other website, and even addresses, credit cards, and other confidential information. While it is convienient for people to have all of their necessary information in one place, it can also be very dangerous. A scenario could occur where you were signed into your Google account on a public computer, and when you leave, you forget to sign out. In this case, anyone could access whatever is stored on this account, whether it is a document with health records or saved passwords that could give access to private accounts. This same sort of danger could happen if someone hacks into the same account by discovering your password. Additionally, if Google itself was hacked and peoples' information was leaked or stolen by the hackers, the same information would be compromised. Although these occurrances may be few and far between, it is still a risk and one should always consider what they want saved on their Google accounts.

Another downside of using one account with Google is that one may become too dependent on it. They may have all of their music, photos, videos, and work or school documents on Google but no where else. If Google were to be shut down or go offline, even if only for a short amount of time, they may lose all of their memories and valued documents. Instead if they were to have backups on a local computer or use other cloud based systems to share the storage, they could be able to save what they need. Even though Google has been very reliant in the past, there is no way of telling what may happen in the future so it would be beneficial to not be so reliant on Google and instead have a back up plan. As the saying goes, it is better to be safe than sorry.
