TL;DR: Piracy is a key issue on the Internet and enforcement of it should be stricter. This article discusses the problems and opinions dealing with piracy as well as interviews a student at a Pennsylvanian college about their knowledge and opinions on Internet piracy.

Stealing and theft of anything has always been considered a sin and a crime. In today's day and age, there is an assumption that these standards apply to digital content on the Internet. This has become somewhat of a controversy as some people see distributing digital goods on the Internet as simply sharing, while many others view it as a detriment to society. This topic however should not even a subject for debate. Piracy on the Internet is a major issue, a real crime, and one that needs to be addressed.

Internet piracy is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as "the practice of using the Internet to illegally copy software and pass it on to other people". Some of the most common forms include sharing music, movies, and software that is sold by other companies or people. There are many websites and ways that individuals from all over the world can find any media they want and download it to their own devices for free. Due to this, companies as well as artists may be losing out on precious revenue since millions of people could gain the same content from only one person purchasing it. It threatens the livelihood of many smaller businesses and artists while also potentially limiting larger entities.

Interview Questions:

  1. Do you know what Internet piracy is?

  2. Do you think that it is common?

  3. Do you think that it is acceptable?

  4. If it is not acceptable, what would be an appropriate punishment?

  5. Have you ever participated in Internet piracy?

  6. What do you think is the most pirated media?

  7. In what ways could piracy be damaging?

  8. Why would someone pirate from the Internet?

  9. Is Internet piracy a victim-less crime?

  10. How could Internet piracy be limited or restricted?

  "In a study about attitudes and perceptions on music downloads using college students as subjects, Levin et al. (2004) found that only 63% of respondents download music. Those who download music have lesser ethical concerns and greater willingness to endorse ethically questionable acts, than those who do not download" (Altschuller 50).

  Answers to the Questions:

  1. Internet piracy is the illegal downloading of material on the web without the authorization of the creator.

  2. I think it is very common among our age group, probably not as much in others.

  3. I think that it can be on a small scale, but not in large amounts or over a long period of time.

  4. An appropriate punishment would just be to make them pay for everything that was pirated. Much more could be seen as excessive.

  5. I have not personally.

  6. Music is probably the most pirated simply because it is the most common. There are many sites that have free music downloads, which makes it easily accessible.

  7. It hurts the artist behind the creation because they are not properly reimbursed for the popularity of their work.

  8. Anyone trying to save money could pirate, and some people are not in a position economically to pay for all of their media, so piracy may be the only way that they can experience some things.

  9. I think it is relatively victimless because the artists and producing companies make enough money off of paid downloads. I donâ€™t think that someone popular enough to be pirated is in desperate need of funding.

  10. The way to slow or stop it could be limiting the accessibility of illegal downloads. There are many sites that are very easy to find, which may tempt some to get the product for free.

Quote: I think that it paints Internet piracy in more of a negative light than it really warrants. It is very common and relatively impossible to be punished for, so many people are likely to utilize it as if it were a free service.
