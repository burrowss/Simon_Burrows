TL;DR: Piracy is a key issue on the Internet and enforcement of it should be stricter. This article discusses the problems and opinions dealing with piracy as well as interviews a student at a Pennsylvanian college about their knowledge and opinions on Internet piracy.

Stealing and theft of anything has always been considered a sin and a crime. In today's day and age, there is an assumption that these standards apply to digital content on the Internet. This has become somewhat of a controversy as some people see distributing digital goods on the Internet as simply sharing, while many others view it as a detriment to society. This topic however should not even a subject for debate. Piracy on the Internet is a major issue, a real crime, and one that needs to be addressed.

Internet piracy is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as "the practice of using the Internet to illegally copy software and pass it on to other people". Some of the most common forms include sharing music, movies, and software that is sold by other companies or people. There are many websites and ways that individuals from all over the world can find any media they want and download it to their own devices for free. Due to this, companies as well as artists may be losing out on precious revenue since millions of people could gain the same content from only one person purchasing it. It threatens the livelihood of many smaller businesses and artists while also potentially limiting larger entities.

  "In a study about attitudes and perceptions on music downloads using college students as subjects, Levin et al. (2004) found that only 63% of respondents download music. Those who download music have lesser ethical concerns and greater willingness to endorse ethically questionable acts, than those who do not download" (Altschuller 50).
