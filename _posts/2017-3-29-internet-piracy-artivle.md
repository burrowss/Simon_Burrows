TL;DR: Piracy is a key issue on the Internet and enforcement of it should be stricter. This article discusses the problems and opinions dealing with piracy as well as interviews a student at a Pennsylvanian college about their knowledge and opinions on Internet piracy.

Stealing and theft of anything has always been considered a sin and a crime. In today’s day and age, there is an assumption that these standards apply to digital content on the Internet. This has become somewhat of a controversy as some people see distributing digital goods on the Internet as simply sharing, while many others view it as a detriment to society. This topic however should not even a subject for debate. Piracy on the Internet is a major issue, a real crime, and one that needs to be addressed. Internet piracy is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as “the practice of using the Internet to illegally copy software and pass it on to other people”. Some of the most common forms include sharing music, movies, and software that is sold by other companies or people. There are many websites and ways that individuals from all over the world can find any media they want and download it to their own devices for free. Due to this, companies as well as artists may be losing out on precious revenue since millions of people could gain the same content from only one person purchasing it. It threatens the livelihood of many smaller businesses and artists while also potentially limiting larger entities.

As a college student, I have come to realize that Internet piracy can be found all throughout school, whether it is music, movies, or textbooks that people download to save money. To gain another perspective outside of my own, I interviewed a friend of mine to find out what he knew about Internet piracy. 

1) Do you know what Internet piracy is?
	
“Internet piracy is the illegal downloading of material on the web without the authorization of the creator”. 

As expected he knew what is was as many people have become aware of this crime and at least know the basics.

2) Do you think that it is common?
	
“I think it is very common among our age group, [yet] probably not as much in others” 

3) Do you think that it is acceptable?
	
“I think that it can be on a small scale, but not in large amounts or over a long period of time”.

I was not surprised that he believed that it was common among teenagers and young adults but his beliefs that it may be acceptable in limited quantities surprised me. This was surprising since he has a strict moral code and high standards of judgment for people, so by thinking that this illegal activity may be alright was not in line of what I believed he would say.

4) If it is not acceptable, what would be an appropriate punishment?
	
“An appropriate punishment would just be to make them pay for everything that was pirated. Much more could be seen as excessive”. 

5) Have you ever participated in Internet piracy?
	
"I have not personally".

6) What do you think is the most pirated media?
	
“Music is probably the most pirated simply because it is the most common. There are many sites that have free music downloads, which makes it easily accessible”. 

Without any research, it seemed like a reasonable claim as there are many, easy ways to download music, while other types of media may be more difficult to pirate. Following research however, I discovered that music accounted for only 2.9% of the top 10,000 torrents in December of 2010 while films accounted for an incredible 35.2% (Internet Bandwidth, 10).


7) In what ways could piracy be damaging?
	
“It hurts the artist behind the creation because they are not properly reimbursed for the popularity of their work”. 

Again, by rational thinking, my friend brought up a key point in the argument against Internet piracy. Intrigued by this statement, I decided to research how much money could be lost to piracy and found that “one credible analysis by the Institute for Policy Innovation concludes that global music piracy causes $12.5 billion of economic losses every year, 71,060 U.S. jobs lost, a loss of $2.7 billion in workers’ earnings, and a loss of $422 million in tax revenues, $291 million in personal income tax and $131 million in lost corporate income and production taxes” (Why, n. pag.). Just as my friend had said, piracy can be very damaging to the economy and people’s income.


8) Is Internet piracy a victim-less crime?

“I think it is relatively victimless because the artists and producing companies make enough money off of paid downloads. I don’t think that someone popular enough to be pirated is in desperate need of funding”. 

While his belief has merit and can be considered reasonable, it slightly contradicts his earlier idea that the artists creating the pirated content are hurt.

9) Why would someone pirate from the Internet?
	
“Anyone trying to save money could pirate, and some people are not in a position economically to pay for all of their media, so piracy may be the only way that they can experience some things”. 

As with the rest of his responses, this reasoning makes a lot of sense, especially after seeing how much music and even textbooks for school can cost. 

10) How could Internet piracy be limited or restricted?

“The way to slow or stop it could be limiting the accessibility of illegal downloads. There are many sites that are very easy to find, which may tempt some to get the product for free”. 

I agree with his idea since Internet piracy is too easy and accessible.

Following the interview, I read him the following quote: 

“In a study about attitudes and perceptions on music downloads using college students as subjects, Levin et al. (2004) found that only 63% of respondents download music. Those who download music have lesser ethical concerns and greater willingness to endorse ethically questionable acts, than those who do not download” (Altschuller 50). 

I then asked him what he thought of it and to offer his opinion about it. He said

"I think that it paints Internet piracy in more of a negative light than it really warrants. It is very common and relatively impossible to be punished for, so many people are likely to utilize it as if it were a free service”. This view on the given quote was one that I had not considered before, as I had thought of the quote as trying to minimize how much Internet piracy there is by using phrases such as “only 63%”.

Internet piracy has been a topic of debate for decades and differing opinions are still alive. By being able to interview a friend of mine at college, as well as researching the topic more in depth, I have been exposed to new perspectives on how Internet piracy should be handled. Overall, I agree with my interviewee with his views that piracy can be harmful and those who pirate should be punished, although not too harshly. While many may see Internet piracy as a harmless service, the fact that it costs the economy and individuals billions of dollars each year is an issue that cannot be ignored. Awareness must be spread so that people are informed of the detriments of Internet piracy. Although it may be hard to enforce, Internet piracy is widespread and must be curtailed. Whether it is changing search engine algorithms so piracy sites are harder to find, or by holding individuals accountable for the software they steal, action needs to be taken so that this piracy can be reigned in.
