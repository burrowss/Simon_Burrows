TL;DR: The Internet is a key part of society but is being threatened by massive industries that are lobbying for an end to Net Neutrality. Action must be taken in order to preserve the Internet as we know it.

American livelihood and culture is under attack, but not from whom you  expect. Instead of being threatened by external threats, cultural normalities are now targeted by large companies within the United States. The telecommunication industry is now fighting Net Neutrality, which should raise concerns from every citizen. Net neutrality has been a heated debate over the past decade as the Internet has grown into every aspect of society. Simply put, net neutrality is "the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should give consumers access to all legal content and applications on an equal basis, without favoring some sources or blocking others" ("What is", n. pag.). As it is now, Internet access is protected by this concept, which has allowed for businesses based on the Internet to grow substantially.
