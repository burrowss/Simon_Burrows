TL;DR: There are both benefits and drawbacks of using the Internet to write. These articles evaluate writing with technology and explore both sides of the argument.

Article One:

An Evaluation of the Use of Github and Markdown to Publish Articles

Throughout the spring semester, in my freshman seminar, we used Github and Markdown to create and write articles. I found this to be incredibly beneficial since it allowed myself to revise my articles anywhere and any time. It also allowed for me not to keep track of physical items such as a notebook, and in doing so made my life much easier. With Github, everyone was able to review my articles and give instant feedback which allowed me to take my writing to the next level. Using Markdown, I was able to customize my articles to my liking with images and links directly in my writing that would have been impossible with traditional writing. Overall, I found the availability and style of writing with Github and Markdown to be very useful and innovative.


Article Two:

The Pros and Cons of Using Github for Preparation of Articles and Presentations

Writing with Github can be both very useful but also detrimental at times. Firstly, Github can be very useful due to its constant availability, use as a platform where instant feedback is possible, and the differences in formatting. It allows for different presentations and writing styles to be created and shown throughout the Internet, which is key in establishing yourself on-line. While these are all helpful, writing with Github can also be hurtful. Although it may seem to always be available, if the power goes out, the Internet goes down, or their servers crash, you would be stuck without any of your writing, assuming you rely solely on writing on the web. Additionally, it could be detrimental to your spelling and grammar since there are so many programs that auto-correct your writing for you, causing your actual writing skills to suffer. It is up to personal preference since there are both benefits and drawbacks to writing on the web, and personally I would rather rely on web writing.
