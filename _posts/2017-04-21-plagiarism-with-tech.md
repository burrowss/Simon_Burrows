As technology has advanced in recent years, so has academics and the resources available to those involved in academia. Today, millions of articles, journals, interviews, and countless other assets are available at anyone's finger tips. But as Stan Lee once said, "With great power comes great responsibility". This responsibility must be that with all of this information available to the world, it is expected for people to give proper credit to those that created it. Unfortunately, many people take others' ideas and work, and pass it off as their own. This act is known as plagiarism. Although some may say that plagiarism has been amplified by technology, technology has in fact made it more difficult for individuals to plagiarize. Even though there are technologies that have made it harder for people to plagiarize, they still are not enough to end this crime alone. Individuals and institutions involved in academia must also step in to end plagiarism and not solely rely on technological services.

Those that plagiarize often search for content that has already been created that relates to their own assignment. They then copy the original creator's work, and claim it as their own. Plagiarism is essentially theft, which harms creators, dissuades people from sharing their work with the world, and is ethically wrong.
